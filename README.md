构建了懂车帝社区问答数据的自动化分析系统，首先通过helium库实现浏览器自动化爬取问答数据并存储结构化字段，随后运用pyecharts生成问答数量时间趋势图和交互式词频分析图表，同时基于jieba分词技术按月提取高频名词和动词进行语义分析，最后整合多维度分析结果形成可视化报告，完整实现了从数据采集、清洗分析到可视化展示的全流程自动化处理，为洞察汽车用户关注热点和社区内容运营提供了数据支持。

An automated analysis system was developed for the Q&A data from the Dongchedi community. The system first uses the Helium library to perform browser automation and scrape structured Q&A data fields. Next, pyecharts is employed to generate time-series charts of question volumes and interactive word frequency visualizations. Based on jieba word segmentation, high-frequency nouns and verbs are extracted on a monthly basis for semantic analysis. Finally, a visual report is produced by integrating multi-dimensional analytical results. This system achieves a fully automated pipeline—from data collection and cleaning to analysis and visualization—providing data-driven insights into user concerns and content operations within the automotive community.
